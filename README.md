Railway Management Database Project:
Developed a comprehensive railway management database using SQL, named railway_system.
Created a Reservation table to manage passenger bookings, including fields for PNR number, passenger details, contact information, booking status, train ID, and travel details.
Implemented data insertion and retrieval queries to facilitate efficient management of reservations, enabling tracking of confirmed and waiting bookings, as well as passenger travel routes.
This project showcases my ability to design and implement database systems, manage data effectively, and perform complex queries to support operational needs.
